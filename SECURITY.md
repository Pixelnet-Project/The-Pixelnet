# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Because this project is still in the infant stages, there is not to be more than one version to be supported at once. The only version that will be supported will be the current one in the main branch in this project. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in The-Pixelnet, first file an issue, so that everyone on the team can see it. Then, contact Pixel#2234 to work out the solution and debugging of the problem. If the vulnerability is accepted, it will be worked on in parallel with all of the other tasks that need to be completed for this project. If the vulnerability is declined, it will not be worked on in parallel, and will be on a lower priority for the team, althought it will be fixed given enough time, and given that it is a legitimate vulnerability that has to be fixed. You will recieve an update about the following: Whether the Vulnerability has been rejected or approved, if a member of the team is currently working on it, and if the vulnerability has been fixed. You will know if the vulnerability has been either fixed or rejected if the issue that was filed was closed.

Thank you for reading, and although I hope that we will find no vulnerabilities in this code, realism always is ready with a huge gavel to smack at the project. Thank you for reading, and may all your bugs be fixed!
